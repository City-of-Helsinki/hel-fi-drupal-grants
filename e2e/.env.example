# Copy this file to create a .env file and make necessary changes.

# =======================

APP_ENV=""

# Set the disabled form variants.
# A "form variant" is a type of form test. If you want to disable
# everything except the "draft" test (saves a form as a draft), you can use this:
# DISABLED_FORM_VARIANTS="success,copy,missing_values,wrong_values,swap_fields,wrong_email,wrong_email_2,wrong_email_3,under5000"
DISABLED_FORM_VARIANTS="success"

# Can be used to explicitly run specific form variants. Others are skipped.
ENABLED_FORM_VARIANTS="draft"

# A flag indicating if profile creation should be forced during test runs.
# If you set this to "FALSE", a new profile will only be created once every hour,
# leading to faster tests.
CREATE_PROFILE="FALSE"

# Wait for text timeout (how long to wait) in MS (defaults to 60000, 1 minute).
# Used by the waitForTextWithInterval() function. This is mainly used when verifying applications sent to Avus2.
WAIT_FOR_TEXT_TIMEOUT="10000"

# Wait for text interval (how often to query) in MS (defaults to 5000, 5 second).
# Used by the waitForTextWithInterval() function. This is mainly used when verifying applications sent to Avus2.
WAIT_FOR_TEXT_INTERVAL="5000"

# A flag indicating if the "debugging mode" should be turned on.
# Messages will be printed during test runs if set to "TRUE".
APP_DEBUG="TRUE"

# Test user SSN (sotu) and UUID.
# Both of these can be fetched from a submitted ATV document using Postman.
# These can and should be changed for your own testing credentials.
TEST_USER_SSN="090797-999P"
TEST_USER_UUID="13cb60ae-269a-46da-9a43-da94b980c067"

# Environemnt cleanup: clean-env.sh searches for these
# IDs from ATV and removes any found documents.
USER_IDS=("uuid1" "uuid2" "uuid3")
BUSINESS_IDS=("business1" "business2" "business3")
