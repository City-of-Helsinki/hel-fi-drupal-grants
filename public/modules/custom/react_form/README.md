# Grants Form React POC

## Installation

- Go to the module's directory
- `nvm use`
- `npm i`
- `npm run start` - starts the watcher
- `npm run build:dev` - builds the dev theme. Since this is the POC, we're only building and serving this. Once things get real, we need to use `npm run build` instead.

## Use

- Go to https://hel-fi-drupal-grant-applications.docker.so/fi/react/nuortoimpalkka or any other /react/ directory followed by an application id.
